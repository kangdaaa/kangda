# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
  summary(cars)
```

## test

plot the diagram "pressure"

```{r pressure}
  plot(pressure)
```


# Including Plots


![](/Users/liukangda/Desktop/C/hello.bmp)


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r mtcars, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(plotly)

datatable(mtcars,rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", options = list(pagelength = 5, scrollX=T))

p<-mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mpg,y=disp))+
      geom_point()

ggplotly(p)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
